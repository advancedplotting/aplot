Matplotlib
----------

The simplicity and power of the Advanced Plotting Toolkit is made possible by
"standing on the shoulders of giants", and making use of existing, 
high-quality, well-tested, and widely deployed technology components.

Foremost among these is the industry-leading `matplotlib <http://matplotlib.org>`_
plotting library, which the Toolkit uses as a central component of the
plotting subsystem.  In addition to core technology such as anti-aliased plots,
many of the advanced Toolkit features, including
:ref:`inline math markup <guide_latex>`,
and :ref:`polar plots <guide_polar>`, are made possible by the
matplotlib library.
